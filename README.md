This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: implicit coercion of a null value to a String.  The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to trace a variable that might be null. The `bugSolution.as` file provides a solution to handle the null value gracefully, preventing the error.
